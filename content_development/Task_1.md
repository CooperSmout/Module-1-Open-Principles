# Task 1: Defining how Open Science affects you

This task is designed for, well, everyone!

Estimated time to complete: 30-90 minutes.

## Getting started <a name="Getting_started"></a>

Welcome to your first task, probably, of the Open Science MOOC! What we *don't* want here is to create something were you sit in front of a screen, basically being lectured like you do at high school or university. We want you to create, to learn, to build, both as an individual and as part of a boundless community. We want to help you to sculpt your own path in research, and tell your own story and use that story to inspire and guide others.

In order to help this, we are going to try something that hasn't really been done before. This MOOC is entirely built on a dynamic 'open source' process, with everything in the open and available to contribution from everyone. We would like you to be part of that.

Throughout these tasks, we will help you to directly create and edit content that becomes part of this MOOC and its companion website. What you do from here on out will directly influence the learning of all individuals who come here in the future. Our job is to guide you in this process, and help you to realise that what you are doing is valuable, to yourself and others.

## Learning how to  use markdown<a name="markdown"></a>

A lot of people think RStudio is just for writing complex scripts for statistical analysis. Wrooooong. It can also be used to write nicely formatted text documents, using something called markdown. Much of this MOOC was written in markdown, and look how nice it all looks!

Markdown is really a simple formatting style that gives you full control over the format of text. If you're used to using something like Microsoft Word, it's kind of similar and gives you the same control over simple things like header style and text format. But in a way that is readable by more software, and can also be easily easily rendered as a webpage.

Here is some basic markdown syntax that might be handy here:

[INSERT SOME BASIC MARKDOWN SYNTAX HERE]

<br/>

## Putting this into practise<a name="draft"></a>

Consider this task a bit like a mini research project to help increase your personal knowledge about Open Science. Here, what we are going to do is write a brief summary article about Open Science either about your research discipline and/or in your country.

We are going to use the simple markdown syntax we just learned about above here. For this, you can use a simple text editor like Notepad, or others that are a little more complex like Atom.

There are several choices you have here:

1. Write about the state of Open Access in your research community or lab group. This can include things like what proportion of articles are OA, whether there is an OA policy, or a summary of how your colleagues and you view OA. For this, it would be good to think about whether existing data are available, and if were they easy to acquire? Make  note of which sources you used, and whether you think these are appropriate to answer the questions.

2. Look at the status of Open Science in your research group or lab. Make a note of who is doing what, using what tools and services, and what their views are. What do you think could be improved?

3. Define clearly what Open Science means to you. Here, we want to make it a little challenging, by having a conversation about it with a colleague. Then, find someone from a different country, and have another conversation about Open Science. How do these view points all differ?

4. Time to investigate! Find out whether policies exist for your research group or institute regarding:

  * Career progression and assessment.

  * Publishing and Open Access.

  * Data sharing.

  * Intellectual Property (IP).
    
Write a brief summary for one of these, and about how it might influence your own research.

5. Identify any repositories for research articles or data for your discipline, as well as any tools and services that are widely used. Make a little table illustrating the key traits for these - you can decide what they are! (e.g., are they Open Source, are they owned by a for-profit company, are the data openly licensed etc.)

That's it! You can keep this as simple or detailed as you like, and depending on what information is available for you. If you don't like any of these options, feel free just to write something about your experiences as a researcher, and what drew you to be here.

<br/>

##** BONUS STEP**<a name="bonus"></a>

Hopefully, you just wrote something pretty awesome, that you are proud of and want to share with others. I mean, after all that effort, why would you not want to? Let's make this a reality.

There are two ways to go about this. If you have an existing website or blog, post it there. That was easy!

For the second route, let's make this a real contribution to the main Open Science MOOC website!

Format your file like this:

`DD-MM-YYYY-your_name.md`

Replacing `your_name` with your_name. Your actual name.

Now, go to [this folder]() and upload your new blog post. Click 'Commit' and simply add a little message describing what you have done. For now, don't worry too much about using GitHub, as we address that in other modules.

What this will do is notify the people who are part of the core MOOC team that a new file has been uploaded. As soon as we 'accept' the new file, just like magic, it will automatically render [here] on the main Open Science MOOC website! How cool is that?

Now, all you have to do is share it. If you use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, GooglePlus, Instagram or whatever, make sure to share your work widely. Let people know what Open Science means to you!

## Checklist <a name="Checklist"></a>

Hopefully now, you will have a greater understanding of just some of the different ways in which Open Science influences you and your research. 

- [ ] You are now familiar with some basic markdown syntax and can use these to draft simple blog posts.
- [ ] You can now describe some of the Open Science policies that influence you, your colleagues, and your research discipline.
- [ ] You have written and shared a blog post illustrating this.

<br/>

**CONGRATULATIONS!** 

You have now help to upgrade your knowledge about Open Science, and have already shared this to help others learn too. 

From now on, it is all up to you! Some advice is to:

* Keep learning. Knowledge is power.
* Keep discussing these things with your colleagues, and develop a collective understanding of how Open Science influences you all in different ways.

<br/>

**Know a way this content can be improved?**

Time to take your new GitHub skills for a test-run! All content development primarily happens [here](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-1-Open-Principles/blob/master/content_development/Task_1.md). If you have a suggested improvement to the content, layout, or anything else, you can make it and then it will automatically become part of the MOOC content after verification from a moderator!
