# Task 1: Defining how Open Science affects you

This task is designed for, well, everyone!

Estimated time to complete: 30-60 minutes.

## Table of contents

* [Getting started](#Getting_started)

Format the file like this:

DD-MM-YYYY-yourname_blah.md

Now, go to [this folder]() and upload your new blog post. Click 'Commit' and simply add a little message describing what you have done. For now, don't worry too much about using GitHub, as we address that in other modules.

What this will do is notify the people who are part of the core MOOC team that a new file has been uploaded. As soon as we 'accept' the new file, just like magic, it will automatically render [here] on the main Open Science MOOC website! How cool is that?

Now, all you have to do is share it. If you use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, GooglePlus, Instagram or whatever, make sure to share your work widely. Let people know what Open Science means to you!


* Write a summary about Open Access efforts either on your research discipline and/or in your country. If you have a website or blog, post it there.

    * Were the data for this easy to acquire? Which sources did you use?

* Look at the status of Open Science in your research group or lab. Make a note of who is doing what. What could be improved?

* Define clearly what Open Science means to you. Have a conversation about it with a colleague. Then, find someone from a different country, and have another conversation about Open Science. 

* Find out the policies are in your department or institute regarding:

    * Career progression and assessment.

    * Publishing and Open Access.

    * Data sharing.

    * Intellectual Property (IP).

* Identify any disciplinary repositories either for research articles or data.
