These are based around documenting your research publications, the online attention these get, your peer reviewer profile, and research collaboration in the open.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are by no means the only platforms available to you, and not limited in scope to documenting your own worth as a researcher. However, what they do help to do is give you a better idea of how your researcher profile is developing, and allow others to see that too.\n",

    "[ORCID](https://orcid.org/) stands for 'Open Researcher and Contributor ID'. It provides you with a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher. It also neatly integrates with key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission, supports automated linkages between you and your professional activities ensuring that your work is recognized. Many journals now require you to have an ORCID profile when submitting manuscripts for publication.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Go to the [ORCID website](https://orcid.org/) and click the 'Register now' link.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enter your name, email address, and password.\n",

    "4. Register.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Employment\n",

    "* Funding\n",

    "\n",
    "* Peer reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll get to the latter of these later via Publons. For the other four, this is just like any other profile generation that you've done before. In each section of your profile, there is a little button that says, for example **+Add education**. Simply click this, and then **+Add manually**, and then enter the information as normal.\n",

Which as well all know can be tiring and frustrating. Here, you can also enter information such as your country of residence, keywords, your website, emails, and other IDs that you might have. It's a good idea here to enter a nice, simple, but comprehensive and professional biography.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, there are three ways to help add scholarly works to your ORCID record.\n",
    "\n",

    "Here are a few simple steps for each to help you get familiar with the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DIRECT IMPORT**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the **Search and link** option.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define the work type and geographical area. Each time you select one of these, it will change the organization options available for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each time you click one of the options, it will take you to the 'oauth' authorization page. Here, make sure only to authorize sources that you trust (which is basically all options) to help keep your data safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After authorizing, you will be taken to the relevant search page for whichever organization you chose (e.g., CrossRef), automatically populated with a search result for your name.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now you can simple select which works you want to be added to your own personal profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Repeat as needed for each organization until you are happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-1-Open-Principles/blob/master/content_development/images/link_orcid.png?raw=true\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**BIBTEX IMPORT**\n",
    "\n",
    "This one is a bit simpler. If you have a personal citation record as a .bib file (BibTeX file format; for example from [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)), you can simply select this from your desktop and upload it. ORCID will do the rest and populate your profile using this. You can use services like the export functions in Google Scholar to make this even easier for yourself too.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also export your works here in .bib format.  BibTeX is a platform-independent, plain-text format used for bibliographic citations. BibTeX files can be created and edited using many popular reference management tools, such as Zotero, so is really handy!\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**MANUAL ADDITION**\n",
    "\n",
    "This one is even simpler. Pop to your profile, click **Add works**, then **+Add manually**. A box should pop up that enables you to enter information as you need. This is generally best for items that don't get integrated using the other two techniques. Try to add as much detail here as possible to be comprehensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allowing trusted organizations to add information to your record ensures the data connected with your ORCID profile is authoritative and trustworthy, as well as saving you time entering information manually. The organization which added the work to your record will be listed as the source of the item. Often, when your work is indexed in one of these organizations, it will automatically integrated with your profile, helping to keep everything up to date.\n",

Proceed with caution..\n",

We make no judgement call on this, and it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they wish to proceed here.

    "1. Decide if your peer review is 'pre-publication' or 'post-publication'. The vast majority will be the first here.\n",

    "2. Enter the name of the journal or conference you performed the review for, as well as the date you submitted it.\n",

    "3. Enter the article title and the DOI (Digital Object Identifier). If the article has not been published yet, there most likely won't be a DOI yet, but don't worry about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Decide the level of overall review privacy. This includes whether or not you can display the review content itself or not, which is often contingent on the editorial policy of the journal. Publons often has an automatic checking procedure in place for this too.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Copy and paste in the review content itself, if you wish. This stage is optional, and again whether or not it will be publicly displayed is based on the editorial policy of the journal. Make sure that you know your sharing rights, as well as the journal policy regarding this, before sharing anything openly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Create the review!\n",
    "\n",
    "7. This will take you to a new page, where you will have options such as getting your review endorsed and verified, scoring the publication, as well as for inviting further feedback on your review. \n",
    "\n",
