*THIS MODULE IS VERY MUCH IN PREP*

Did you know that the Internet and the World Wide Web were both originally designed for research purposes? Researchers wanted a fast, easy, and low-cost way for sharing data with each other, and hence the Internet was born. Now, the Internet dominates almost all aspects of our daily lives, and has deviated from this original purpose. Yet, from this, science seems to have gone backwards compared to every other enterprise - Open Science is the movement to bring modern research into line with this original digital intent.

## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

Welcome to Module 1 of the Open Science MOOC: Open Principles. This is the first of 10 core modules to give you a solid grounding in all things Open Science. This module has been developed [in the open](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-1-Open-Principles) through collaboration by an international team of [Open Science wizards](#Development_team).

To innovate in a field frequently implies moving against prevailing trends and cultural inertia. Open Science is no different. The fact that you are here, reading this now, means that you have an interest in the impact that Open Science can have on improving research cultures.

This module will introduce to you the guiding principles, values, and practices of the 'Open Science movement', some of the barriers to these, and the positive impact that integrating Open Science into your daily research work can have on you.

### Who is this module for? <a name="Who_for"></a>

Designed primarily for students and researchers at the graduate and undergraduate level this module can also serve as training material for postdocs and senior researchers. It is a cross-disciplinary module covering all research branches, including Engineering, Medicine, Mathematics, Biosciences, Social Sciences and Humanities, and Arts. 

> "Open science describes the practice of carrying out scientific research in a completely transparent manner, and making the results of that research available to everyone. Isn’t that just ‘science’?!" - Mick Watson [(source)](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-1-Open-Principles/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Principles/Watson%2C%202015.pdf)

<br/>

### Specific learning objectives for this module <a name="Objectives"></a>

1. Understand the ethical, legal, social, economic, and research impact arguments for and against Open Science.

2. Set up a personal profile for defining your impact: measure the social and academic attention on the full range of research processes and outputs.

<br/>

## What is Open Science? <a name="What_is"></a>

The term 'Open Science' has not yet a universally accepted definition, but usually refers to one core theme: **Increasing knowledge availability as a public good**, typically with critical research aspects such as credibility, reproducibility, and verifiability thrown in in some combination. There are many alternative terms to Open Science too, such as Open Research, Open Scholarship, Science 2.0, eScience, and here. Throughout this MOOC, we consider 'Open Science' to be fully inclusive of all of these terms, and to reflect the process of organised knowledge creation [(Bartling and Friesike, 2014)](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-1-Open-Principles/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Principles/Bartling%20and%20Friesike%2C%202014.pdf).

[Can we not cite Wikipedia here? Or also get a team work on the OS wikipedia entry?]

> [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/) defines Open Science as: "The movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society."

Open Science can broadly be viewed as a way of enhancing scientific progress through sharing of knowledge and methods, wider collaboration, and increased rigour. Would we all want this by default as part of our core values and Good Scientific Practices. Research can only thrive if shared and built upon. 

Key goals of the Open Science movement include:

* Freely available access to all outputs of the research process;

* Increased equity and inclusive participation in research;

* Better and more diverse and creative interpretations of scientific results;

* More rigorous, transparent evaluation of research processes and outcomes;

* Enhanced and collaborative re-use of research outcomes, reducing costs, waste and redundancy;

* More comprehensive research practices incentivised through more diverse reward systems;

* Accelerated innovation and public impact: and

* Greater reproducibility of research results, enhancing trustability and integrity.

[Mention some of the recent achievements and the estimated percentage of open vs closed science // is there a timeline graph somehwere how Research was gradually locked behind paywalls and now opens up again?]

However, what we know is that this ideal is often divergent from reality: Research papers remain locked behind expensive paywalls, critical research data remains hidden away on a hard-drive somewhere, methods remain scantly documented, research results cannot be reproduced, and researchers are often evaluated on senseless criteria. These are just some examples of typical practices that contribute to what might be viewed as 'closed science'; or to look at it another way, bad scientific practices. 

Open Science is about changing these research practices through a shift in culture. The power of modern Web technologies enables instantaneous sharing, global collaboration, and in an unrestricted fashion. This shift in research culture is often referred to as the [**Scholarly Commons**](https://www.force11.org/group/scholarly-commons-working-group), which seeks to explore and redefine what a modern scholarly communication ecosystem should look like. 

The digital era is transforming the way in research is performed, and the limitations of the print era are gone. With this, new issues arise, which include the complexities of knowledge capture and communication. The framing of these complexities as a 'Commons' integrates the political, social, economic, and philosophical dimensions around knowledge.


### History of Open Science and Open Cultures <a name="Cultures"></a>

Science wants to be Open by default.

The earliest form of Open Science can perhaps trace its origins back the 17th century, and the origin of the academic journal. [CITE FYFE etc HERE] This was catalysed by an increasing demand for the wider dissemination of scientific knowledge with the wider public. 

Although difficult to pin down exactly, the origins of what many call the modern 'Open Science movement' was probably catalysed by increasing frustration, debate, and distress regarding the impacts of 'closed science' (e.g., barriers such as subscription paywalls) and commercialisation on knowledge dissemination. Indeed, one of the rallying cries of the Open Science movement is that taxpayers who already paid to fund research should not be having to pay again to read the results. The term Open Science itself appears to have been coined by [Steve Mann in 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science#Coining_of_phrase_%22OpenScience%22).

In the last two decades, there has been an explosive growth in the development of different aspects of scholarly infrastructure - the core, underpinning aspects of a well-functioning research machine. Much of this is a blend of non-profit and commercial services, which are now variably integrated, but has created a strange and complex new system of ways to perform and communicate research.

From this, what might be becoming a little more clear is that Open Science is about systemic change. It challenges the way research is conducted, at a practical and cultural level, the way it is evaluated, and the ways in which scientific knowledge is disseminated. Much of this is ingrained into research culture through self-reinforcing local governance systems, which are often imposed through external capitalist pressure. For example, the '*publish or perish*' mantra is a direct consequence of these pressures, which in turn are linked to the evolving neoliberal agenda imposed by modern research institutes.

So now, if this makes sense to you, it might seem like Open Science is in almost direct conflict with a capitalistic culture. 

Open Science really hit the mainstream around 2016 due to a number of possible reasons. A combination of political activity and grassroots community-led initiatives really put it on the map, and now everywhere you go in science, openness is all around in one way or another.

For example, there has been a strong focus on Open Science in the last few years in Europe, with one of the biggest developments coming from this being the [European Open Science Cloud](http://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-cloud) (EOSC).

[Give examples of more countries' OS activities here - NOT JUST EUROPE]


### Differences in understanding and interpretation <a name="interpretation"></a>

As mentioned above, there does not seem to be a single accepted definition of what Open Science is. Ask one person, and they will tell you it is about making datasets and research papers public. Ask another, and they will tell you about a vision for a 'radical' transformation of scholarship, where all processes and outputs are instantaneously public. The extent to which different communities and disciplines have embraced and adopted Open Science practices is extremely variable.

There are two ways too look at this. First, some might argue that the power of a definition lies in its precision, and helps to avoid distortion of those definitions - what some might, in this case, call "open washing". Second, flexibility in the definition, and its understanding and interpretation, lead to increased familiarity with a concept as a 'boundary object'. For the latter, and for Open Science, this means that while it might be interpreted differently across different communities with a variety of norms and practices, the foundational understanding that Open Science is good for public access to knowledge is universally accepted.

There are also [geopolitical](https://medium.com/@denalbz/power-and-inequality-in-open-science-discourses-9d425b0c2b63) differences that shape our understanding of Open Science. For example, in Europe, and much of the developed world, Open Science has an inherently market-oriented language that promotes economic value, productivity, and competition, above all other factors. However, for many of those in the 'global south', Open Science is more about fostering community-building through knowledge sharing, and nurturing social networks around new technologies and infrastructures.

<br/>

## Principles of Open Science <a name="Principles"></a>

Now, there are no rules about Open Science, and no one individual or organisation is setting the agenda. However, what is commonly recognised is that Open Science is underpinned by specific, core principles and values. In recognition of this, there are now around [100 charters and declarations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-aRXFiRg-VL9hpLpxoJqX6-OC-A0R2oCogHfIx52Nug/edit#gid=956616118) to do with data sharing and scholarly communication and publishing, and hundreds more [advocacy organisations](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Advocacy_organizations_for_OA) that make openness a significant part of their mission.

Note that often you will find things described as Open Science, but that do not seem to embrace these principles. These things are probably not 'true' Open Science, but more just attempting to surf the wave or join the bandwagon as a PR stunt. Such things are often called 'open washing'.

[![Open & Collaborative Science Manifesto
](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y1X0xtB_JcY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1X0xtB_JcY)

<p align="center"><i>Open and Collaborative Science Manifesto. This video describes the 7 principles that constitute a more open and inclusive science in development. CC BY <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=Y1X0xtB_JcY" target="_blank">Source</a></i></p>

This above video from [OCSDNet](https://ocsdnet.org/manifesto/open-science-manifesto/) is absolutely critical in framing the principles of Open Science. It outlines the importance of representation and inclusivity within Open Science, and the importance of these in challenging the core values of traditional science. They propose **seven principles** for Open and Collaborative Science:

* **Principle 1**: Enables a knowledge commons where every individual has the means to decide how their knowledge is governed and managed to address their needs.

* **Principle 2**: It recognizes cognitive justice, the need for diverse understandings of knowledge making to co-exist in scientific production.

* **Principle 3**: It practices situated openness by addressing the ways in which context, power and inequality condition scientific research

* **Principle 4**: It advocates for every individual’s right to research and enables different forms of participation at all stages of the research process.

* **Principle 5**: It fosters equitable collaboration between scientists and social actors and cultivates co-creation and social innovation in society.

* **Principle 6**: It incentivizes inclusive infrastructures that empower people of all abilities to make, and use accessible open-source technologies.

* **Principle 7**: It strives to use knowledge as a pathway to sustainable development, equipping every individual to improve the well-being of our society and planet.

Another widely-known vision for the future of scholarly communication is the [Vienna Principles](https://viennaprinciples.org/).

### Community values in Open Science <a name="values"></a>
 
Including diversity, inclusivity, fairness, equity, social behaviour, accountability, ethics and responsibility.


> How do we use open science approaches in the context of retooling our institutions to benefit actual living and breathing humans (scientists and nonscientists)? How can we use open science to enable as many people who have the interest and talent to pursue science for it’s own sake and to generate knowledge that is broadly useful for society, and not just elite institutions, venture capital firms or global megacorporations? - Alex Lancaster [(source)](http://ronininstitute.org/open-science-and-its-discontents/).

<br/>

## The global landscape of Open Science <a name="landscape"></a>

The production of research knowledge is inherently geopolitical, as emphasised by [The Knowledge Gap](http://knowledgegap.org/). There are strange forces at play that influence representation, mechanisms of distribution, dimensions of power, and structural inequalities throughout the global scholarly communication system. These all contribute towards a complex, and fragmented, global Open Science landscape.

> To see Open Science as a historically produced discourse, we need to first abandon the notion that openness is always inherently positive and/or neutral. We then need to revise and contextualize openness within their particular historical legacies, contexts and and sociopolitical struggles. Denisse Albornoz [(Source)](https://medium.com/@denalbz/power-and-inequality-in-open-science-discourses-9d425b0c2b63).


<br/>

## The different dimensions of Open Science <a name="dimensions"></a>

Open Science, just like 'regular science', is a complicated construct. Thankfully, a lot of great work has already been performed to help frame the different contexts of Open Science. One of the most commonly used is the Open Science taxonomy from FOSTER, shown below:

![FOSTER Open Science taxonomy](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-1-Open-Principles/blob/master/content_development/images/os_taxonomy.png)

<p align="center"><i><a href="https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/about#download" target="_blank">FOSTER Open Science taxonomy</i></p>

<br/>

Another popular framing device is the 'Open Science schools of thought', by [Benedikt Fecher and Sascha Friesike](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-1-Open-Principles/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Principles/Fecher%20and%20Friesike%2C%202014.pdf):

1. The **Infrastructure school**, which is concerned with how the architecture of new technologies can help to make a more efficient research enterprise;

2. The **Public school**, regards the accessibility of knowledge creation to a wider audience;

3. The **Measurement school**, concerned with alternative methods of assessing scientfic impact development;

4. The **Democratic school**, based around fundamental rights of access to knowledge; abd

5. The **Pragmatic school**, concerning the role of collaborative research for more efficient knowledge creation and dissemination.

Recently, the [Foundations for Open Scholarship Strategy Development](https://zenodo.org/record/1323437#.W2bIJSj7RPY) added a 6th to this, the [Community and Inclusion school](https://open-scholarship-strategy.github.io/site/#Community).

## How Open Science impacts you <a name="impacts"></a>

[**GO TO TASK 1: Defining how Open Science affects you**]


### Changes in research evaluation <a name="evaluation"></a>

The world of research evaluation is slowly changing. While there is generally little empirical evidence, it is generally accepted that research evaluation is almost entirely contingent on getting research articles published in 'high impact' journal venues.

One consequence of this, is that other elements of the research process, are seen as less important. This includes Open Science, which can be viewed as risky or detrimental to the career choices of an individual research, and in particular those who are already disadvantaged/marginalised, or at an earlier stage in their career.

Perhaps a much bigger consequence of this, however, is that we essentially have a system where researchers are rewarded for how many papers they publish, and the brands associated with the venue of publication, which can be detrimental to the value of shared knowledge.

Things are changing, though. It is becoming more widely realised that these publication-based incentives are detrimental to the research process, and the health of research culture. For example, this comes from an [advertisement for a professorship at the Ludwig Maximillian University](http://www.nicebread.de/open-science-hiring-practices/), Munich, and is the first time that Open Science was made an explicit part of hiring criteria:

> "Our department embraces the values of open science and strives for replicable and reproducible research. For this goal we support transparent research with open data, open material, and pre-registrations. Candidates are asked to describe in what way they already pursued and plan to pursue these goals."

Having Open Science as a core value in research departments sends a strong message for a shift in research cultures.

<br/>


## Barriers to Open Science <a name="barriers"></a>

Open Science reflects the intentions of the researchers themselves, and is thereby subject to cultural bias. Open Science is not a perfect system by any means, and operates a hierarchy between different barriers. For example, Open Access seeks to remove barriers such as price for readers and re-use permissions, but often fails to address barriers such as connectivity or language, and also in cases erect new barriers, such as author-facing costs.

This is something which the Open Science movement is becoming more and more aware of, especially regarding the risks and impacts that progress towards Open Science can have, particularly on marginalised demographics or already higher-risk communities. Some of the major barriers towards Open Science include:

* Forcing junior researchers to share their data at point of first publication, potentially compromising their future research based on those data;

* High article processing charges (APCs) for publication, that discriminate against those without financial privilege;

* Other [geopolitical factors](https://medium.com/@denalbz/power-and-inequality-in-open-science-discourses-9d425b0c2b63) include resistance to sharing due to fear of persecution, and knowledge miszuse or appropriation.

* 



However, as well as these, there are several worrying and ongoing trends that reflect more systemic issues within Open Science, and scholarship more generally:

* That Open Science is introducing more metrics to 'incentivise' researchers to work harder, at the cost of true productivity and creativity, and not always in their best interests;

* That new gate-keepers are consolidating these metrics, and using them to define the future of research, ending up with a system operating more like a business than an exploratory venture;

* The increasing capture of research and infrastructure by commercial, for-profit entities, reflecting the increasing neoliberal market organisation around science and higher education;

* These same entities often having a parasitic relationship with researchers, who provide labour, services, and content for free to help them build profits;

* A lack of job stability or security and resources, which acts against innovation or any form of risk-taking;

* A lack of consideration of the social and cultural real-world benefits of research; and

* The fact that most historical research still remains locked away from access or re-use.

Based on this, it is interesting to ask why such dangerous trends seem to grow from seemingly good intentions based on positive core principles and values. It might be easy, based on the above, to become extremely pessimistic, or even antagonistic, towards Open Science. However, as with any movement or new way of doing things, it is down to each of us to carefully balance the potential drawbacks and benefits, and the wider consequences and contexts of these.

### Moving away from tradition and the status quo <a name="tradition"></a>

While the core principles underlying Open Science are often focussed around accessibility, in practice there is often a trade-off within this hierarchy, and often with unforeseen consequences. Much of this is not due to the intentions of Open Science, but more about the difficulties in reconciling the different stakeholder viewpoints, which often leads to inherent conflict and complications around developments.

[Include: lobbying, resistance to shifting away from impact factor, resistance to openness, co-opting of OA and Open Science by publishers. Need to add this section to TOC.]

It is perfectly natural for researchers and industries that have made themselves successful or profitable based on a particular set of practices to resist any disruption towards that. Let us take two primary examples for this.

1. Moving research evaluation away from journal brands and the impact factor.

2. Moving away from a subscription model to one where all information is freely available.

<br/>

## Open Science and reproducible research <a name="profile"></a>

There is an enormous overlap between Open Science and reproducible research. Now, traditionally, much of the research process, as well as the outputs, remain hidden or closed from public scrutiny. Open Science attempts to expose some of this process; for example, by recording and documenting 'failed' reactions, highlighting repeated experiments and their variants, and revealing thoughts, ideas, and comments that were part of the process but wouldn't make into a final research paper. 

All of these elements can be documented as part of a 'lab notebook', and comes with an important implication: **The aspects of research that did not produce favourable results are just as important as those which do.** 

<br/>

## Making Open Science part of your daily research workflow <a name="workflow"></a>

As you might now see, Open Science impacts almost every aspect of the typical research workflow. There are a number of tools, services, platforms, and practices for you to engage with, and this will likely differ for each individual, lab group, or community.

There are no set rules though. Open Science gives you the freedom to explore processes that work best for you, your research, and the impact that can have on your wider community. Below is just one combination of examples of tools that can make your research workflow more open all the way from an initial grant proposal through to research assessment.

![Rainbow of Open Science Practices](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-1-Open-Principles/blob/master/content_development/images/rainbow-of-open-science-practices.png)

<p align="center"><i>Kramer, Bianca, & Bosman, Jeroen. (2018, January). Rainbow of open science practices. Zenodo. <a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1147025" target="_blank">http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1147025</a></i></p>

<br/>

## Where to go from here <a name="future"></a>

Hopefully now you have come to see the importance of Open Scientific principles, values, and practices as a fundamental part of modern science. Open Science is an umbrella term for a range of ideals, values, practices, and principles, all of which are integrated together:

[![Open & Collaborative Science Manifesto
](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Es7qvO_2kSg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es7qvO_2kSg)

The **learning outcomes** from this should be:

* You will now be able to describe the ethical, legal, social, cultural, economic, and research impact arguments for and against Open Science.

* After deciding which platforms/tools/services are most useful for yourself and your community, you will be able to develop a personal profile for showcasing their research profile and outputs.

* After reflecting on the status of Open Science within their research group or lab, you will help to devise concrete ways to locally improve open practices.

* Using the guidelines published by their research laboratories, departments, or institutes, you will be able to help identify the policies for career progression and assessment, publishing and open access, data sharing, and intellectual property.

* You will be able to further collaborate with colleagues and international peers to develop a shared definition of Open Science.
