## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

Welcome to Module 1 of the Open Science MOOC: Open Principles. This module has been developed [in the open](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-1-Open-Principles) through collaboration by an international team of [Open Science wizards]().

To innovate in a field frequently implies moving against prevailing trends and cultural inertia. Open Science is no different. No matter how convinced you are, you will come across resistance from peers and colleagues, and the best defence is strong personal conviction that what you are doing may not be perfect now, but is the right decision in the long run. This module will introduce the guiding principles of the 'open movement', the different actors involved, and the impact that they are having.

### Who is this module for? <a name="Who_for"></a>

This module is designed primarily for students and researchers at the graduate and undergraduate level. It is a cross-disciplinary module, and therefore covers all research branches, including Engineering, Medicine, Maths, Social Sciences and Humanities, Arts, and STEM subjects.

### Specific learning objectives for this module <a name="Objectives"></a>


1. Understand the ethical, legal, social, economic, and research impact arguments for and against Open Science.

2. Set up a personal profile for defining your impact: measure the social and academic attention on the full range of research processes and outputs.

## Where to go from here <a name="future"></a>

Hopefully now you have come to see the importance of Open Scientific principles, values, and practices as a fundamental part of modern science.

The **learning outcomes** from this should be:

* You will now be able to describe the ethical, legal, social, cultural, economic, and research impact arguments for and against Open Science.

* After deciding which platforms/tools/services are most useful for yourself and your community, you will be able to develop a personal profile for showcasing their research profile and outputs.

* After reflecting on the status of Open Science within their research group or lab, you will help to devise concrete ways to locally improve open practices.

* Using the guidelines published by their research laboratories, departments, or institutes, you will be able to help identify the policies for career progression and assessment, publishing and open access, data sharing, and intellectual property.

* You will be able to further collaborate with colleagues and international peers to develop a shared definition of Open Science.
