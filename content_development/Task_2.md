# Task 2: Developing your digital researcher profile

This task is designed for researchers who want to help to build their online profile while helping to amplify their work. Think of this task like a way of creating an online CV for your work.

Estimated time to complete:  minutes.

## Getting started <a name="Getting_started"></a>

OK, so in the main content here, we just briefly introduced you to three services that you can use to enhance our researcher profile. These are based around documenting your research publications, the online attention these get, and your peer reviewer profile. 

These are by no means the only platforms available to you, and not limited in scope to documenting your own worth as a researcher. However, what they do help to do is give you a better idea of how your researcher profile is developing, and allow others to see that too.

The three we met before are:

* **ORCID** - A a persistent identifier for you and your research.

* **ImpactStory** - A place to document how your research has been shared and re-used online.

* **Publons** - A place to document your peer review activities.

The latter two of these actually integrate nicely with ORCID and pull in all the information there to make building your profile a bit easier. Here, we are going to go through each one and help to showcase your work and build your research profile.

## Getting your ORCID account<a name="ORCID"></a>

[ORCID](https://orcid.org/) stands for 'Open Researcher and Contributor ID'. It provides you with a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher. It also neatly integrates with key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission, supports automated linkages between you and your professional activities ensuring that your work is recognized.


### How to register for your ORCID account<a name="reg_orcid"></a>

This one is dead easy, and only takes a couple of minutes thankfully! Here's how in a few simple steps:

1. Go to the [ORCID website](https://orcid.org/) and click the 'Register now' link.

2. Enter your name, email address, and password.

3. Choose your visibility settings. You can change these for each item in your ORCID profile later if needed.

4. Register. 

That's it! Congratulations, you now have a unique and permanent ID for your research profile! 

### Populating your ORCID profile<a name="pop_orcid"></a>

Now you have your ORCID profile, it's time to add some content to it! 


[NOTE: SHOULD WE ADD THE OSF AS A BONUS STEP HERE TOO?]
