## Getting started <a name="Getting_started"></a>

OK, so in the main content here, we just briefly introduced you to three services that you can use to enhance our researcher profile. These are based around documenting your research publications, the online attention thee get, and your peer reviewer profile. 

These are by no means the only platforms available to you, and not limited in scope to documenting your own worth as a researcher. However, what they do help to do is give you a better idea of how your researcher profile is developing, and allow others to see that too.

The three we met before are:

* **ORCID** - A a persistent identifier for you and your research.

* **ImpactStory** - A place to document how your research has been shared and re-used online.

* **Publons** - A place to document your peer review activities.

The latter two of these actually integrate nicely with ORCID and pull in all the information there to make building your profile a bit easier. Here, we are going to go through each one and help to showcase your work and build your research profile.

[NOTE: SHOULD WE ADD THE OSF AS A BONUS STEP HERE TOO?]
