# Task 2: Developing your digital researcher profile

**You are more than just your publications.**

This task is designed for researchers who want to help to build their online profile while helping to amplify their work. Think of this task like a way of creating an online CV for your work.

Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes.

Estimated time saved: Immeasurable, but probably a lot.

## Getting started <a name="Getting_started"></a>

OK, so in the [main content](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-1-Open-Principles/blob/master/content_development/MAIN.md) for this module, we just briefly introduced you to three services that you can use to enhance our researcher profile. These are based around documenting your research publications, the online attention these get, and your peer reviewer profile. 

These are by no means the only platforms available to you, and not limited in scope to documenting your own worth as a researcher. However, what they do help to do is give you a better idea of how your researcher profile is developing, and allow others to see that too.

The three we met before are:

* [**ORCID**](https://orcid.org/) - A persistent identifier for you and your research.

* [**ImpactStory**](http://impactstory.org/) - A place to document how your research has been shared and re-used online.

* [**Publons**](https://publons.com/home/) - A place to document your peer review activities.

The latter two of these actually integrate nicely with ORCID and pull in all the information there to make building your profile a bit easier. Here, we are going to go through each one and help to showcase your work and build your own unique research profile.

<br/>

## Getting your ORCID account<a name="ORCID"></a>

[ORCID](https://orcid.org/) stands for 'Open Researcher and Contributor ID'. It provides you with a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher. It also neatly integrates with key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission, supports automated linkages between you and your professional activities ensuring that your work is recognized.

<p align="center"><i>3 simple steps to distinguish yourself</i></p>

<br/>

### How to register for your ORCID account<a name="reg_orcid"></a>

This one is dead easy, and only takes a couple of minutes thankfully! Here's how in a few simple steps:

1. Go to the [ORCID website](https://orcid.org/) and click the 'Register now' link.

2. Enter your name, email address, and password.

3. Choose your visibility settings. You can change these for each item in your ORCID profile later if needed.

4. Register. 

That's it! Congratulations, you now have a unique and permanent ID for your research profile!

<br/>

### Populating your ORCID profile<a name="pop_orcid"></a>

Now you have your ORCID profile, it's time to add some content to it! There are several key areas here:

* Education

* Employment

* Funding

* Works (e.g., papers, posters)

* Peer reviews

We'll get to the latter of these later via Publons. For the other four, this is just like any other profile generation that you've done before. In each section of your profile, there is a little button that says, for example **+Add education**. Simply click this, and then **+Add manually**, and then enter the information as normal.

<p align="center"><i>How to update your ORCID profile</i></p>

<br/>

The great advantage that ORCID has here is that this information can be ported into other systems, so stops you haing to enter the same data over and over again across different platforms. Here, you can also enter information such as your country of residence, keywords, your website, emails, and other IDs that you might have. It's a good idea here to enter a nice, simple, but comprehensive biography.

For now, there are three ways to help add scholarly works to your ORCID record.

1. Direct import from other systems;

2. Import/export via BibTeX; and

3. Manual addition.

<br/>

<p align="center"><i>How to update the 'works' associated with your ORCID profile</i></p>

<br/>

Here are a few simple steps for each.

**DIRECT IMPORT**

1. Click the **Search and link** option.

2. Define the work type and geographical area. Each time you select one of these, it will change the organization options available for you.

3. Each time you click one of the options, it will take you to the 'oauth' authorization page. Here, make sure only to authorize sources that you trust (which is basically all options) to help keep your data safe.

4. After authorizing, you will be taken to the relevant search page for whichever organization you chose, automatically populated with a search result for your name. 

5. Now you can simple select which works you want to be added to your own personal profile. 

6. Repeat as needed for each organization until you are happy.

**BIBTEX IMPORT**

This one is a bit simpler. If you have a citation record as a .bib file (BibTeX file format), you can simply select this from your desktop and upload it. ORCID will do the rest and populate your profile using this. You can use services like the export functions in Google Scholar to make this even easier.

**MANUAL ADDITION**

This one is dead simple. Simply go to your profile, click **Add works**, then **+Add manually**. A box should pop up that enables you to enter information as you need. This is generally best for items that don't get integrated using the other two techniques. Try to add as much detail here as possible to be comprehensive.


Allowing trusted organizations to add information to your record ensures the data connected with your ORCID iD is authoritative and trustworthy, as well as saving you time entering information manually. The organization which added the work to your record will be listed as the source of the item. Often, when your work is indexed in one of these organizations, it will automatically integrated with your profile, helping to keep everything up to date.
